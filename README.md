# SMAI Assignments (IIIT-H)

This repository contains my SMAI assignment notebooks organized by assignment number.

## Structure
- `assignments/A1` — Notebooks: 1–3
- `assignments/A2` — Notebooks: 1–7 + output videos (`segmentation_video_1.mp4`, `segmentation_video_2.mp4`)
- `assignments/A3` — Notebooks: 1–3 + output GIFs (`cat_comparison.gif`, `smiley_comparison.gif`)
- `assignments/A4` — Notebooks: 1–3 + `Q3/` folder
- `assignments/A5` — Notebooks: 1–4

## Notes
- Only notebooks + selected outputs are included (no datasets, training logs, wandb runs, or environments).
- Run notebooks top-to-bottom; some tasks expect external datasets (not included here).
